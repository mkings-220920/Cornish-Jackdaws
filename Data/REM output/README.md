- 'coop_only.RData' is a dataset that contains all of the time-varying covariates (as calculated in Eventnet), but without 'non-events' (i.e. hypothetical/expected events as generated by the permutation procedure). As it only contains the observed events, this dataframe is used at points in the 'MK_REMs' script for plotting.
- The 'Model coefficients' folder contains the output of REMs as applied to each permuted dataset. For each analysis there were 10,000 permuted datasets. Consequently, each '.Rdata' file in the folder contains the REM coefficients, in list format, output from each model. These coefficient distributions were used to calculate median coefficient values and confidence intervals. See README in the folder for additional detail.
- Similarly, the 'Predicted values' folder contains the model predictions used in the figures. See README in the folder for additional detail.
