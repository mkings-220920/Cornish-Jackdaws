- FeedExp_pairs100419.csv contains the relevant life-history information for all known individuals (i.e. jackdaws that were ringed or identified as a nest-box owner). 
- Feedexp_trtmnt_assign2019.R is the code used to randomly assign individuals to treatment classes. Note, the first few lines (lines 6-14) will not run as the overall dataframe containing all life-history information is not made available here. However, the result of these processing steps 'fexp_all' is provided and can be used to run the rest of the script.
