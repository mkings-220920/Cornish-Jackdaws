- FeedExp_pairs100419.csv contains the relevant life-history information for all known individuals (i.e. jackdaws that were ringed or identified as a nest-box owner). 
- Feedexp_trtmnt_assign2019.R is the code used to randomly assign individuals to treatment classes. Note, the first few lines (lines 6-14) will not run as the overall dataframe containing all life-history information is not made available here. However, the result of these processing steps 'fexp_all' (see fexp_all.csv file) is provided and can be used to run the rest of the script.
- The output of the above script, two text files containing the RFID codes of the individuals assigned to each class/group (1 or 2), are also provided (coopgrp1.txt and coopgrp2.txt)
